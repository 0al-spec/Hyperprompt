# FLOW TODO - VSC-3 Extension Scaffold

- [x] SELECT next task and update DOCS/INPROGRESS/next.md
- [x] Update DOCS/Workplan.md with **INPROGRESS** marker
- [x] PLAN: create DOCS/INPROGRESS/VSC-3_Extension_Scaffold.md
- [x] INSTALL_SWIFT: confirm swift --version works (skip install if present)
- [ ] EXECUTE pre-flight checks (git clean, dependencies satisfied, PRD exists)
- [ ] EXECUTE ready prompt acknowledged before implementation
- [ ] EXECUTE validation and finalization after implementation

Note: EXECUTE pre-flight requires a clean git working tree; current flow outputs are uncommitted.
