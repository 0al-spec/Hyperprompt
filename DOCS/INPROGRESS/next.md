# Next Task: B1  Integrate Specifications into Reference Resolver

**Priority:** P1
**Phase:** Phase 4: Reference Resolution
**Effort:** 3 hours
**Dependencies:** Spec-3 
**Status:** ✅ Completed on 2025-12-13

## Description

Integrate ValidReferencePathSpec and PathTypeDecision specifications into the ReferenceResolver. ValidReferencePathSpec provides declarative validation for file reference paths (no traversal, allowed extensions), while PathTypeDecision classifies paths into allowed/forbidden/invalid categories. This replaces remaining imperative validation logic with declarative specifications.

## Next Step

Run PLAN command to generate detailed PRD:
