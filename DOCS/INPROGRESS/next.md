# Next Task: OPT-DET — Verify deterministic output (repeated compilations identical)

**Priority:** P0
**Phase:** Phase 9: Optimization & Finalization
**Effort:** 3 hours
**Dependencies:** E2
**Status:** ✅ Completed on 2025-12-12

## Description

Validate that repeated compilations produce byte-for-byte identical outputs following cross-platform testing to ensure deterministic behavior before release preparation.

## Next Step

Execution complete. Deterministic timestamp provider added with environment overrides; validation hashes recorded in `DOCS/INPROGRESS/OPT-DET_Verify_deterministic_output.md`.
