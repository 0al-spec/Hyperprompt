# Task Status

A task can have one of the following statuses in the Workplan:

- **[ ]** — Incomplete task (checkbox unchecked)
- **[x]** — Completed task (checkbox checked)
- **INPROGRESS** — Currently being worked on (marked with bold text)

## Rules

1. Only tasks with **[ ]** status can be selected
2. Completed tasks **[x]** are skipped from selection
3. When a task is selected, it gets marked with **INPROGRESS**
4. Only one task should be INPROGRESS at a time
