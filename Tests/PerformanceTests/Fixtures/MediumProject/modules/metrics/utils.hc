# Metrics — Utils

This module handles metrics utils functionality.

## Utils Section 1

This component provides essential functionality for managing 0 operations. It integrates seamlessly with the core system architecture.

```swift
// Example implementation for metrics
struct MetricsHandler {
    func process() async throws -> Result {
        // Processing logic here
        return .success
    }
}
```

The implementation uses modern Swift patterns including async/await, structured concurrency, and strong type safety.

Key features include automatic error recovery, comprehensive logging, and performance optimization through caching strategies.
