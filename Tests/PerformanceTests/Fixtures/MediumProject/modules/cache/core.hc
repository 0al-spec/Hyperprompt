# Cache — Core

This module handles cache core functionality.

## Core Section 1

This component provides essential functionality for managing 0 operations. It integrates seamlessly with the core system architecture.

```swift
// Example implementation for cache
struct CacheHandler {
    func process() async throws -> Result {
        // Processing logic here
        return .success
    }
}
```

The implementation uses modern Swift patterns including async/await, structured concurrency, and strong type safety.

Key features include automatic error recovery, comprehensive logging, and performance optimization through caching strategies.
